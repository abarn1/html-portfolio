<hr />
<h3>Your Name (君の名は)</h3>
<p>Absolutely gorgeous animation combined with a really fascinating story with a fun little twist thrown in.</p>
<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>Not the most amazing movie but I really like the story and the cinematography and locations are pretty fun to watch.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I like the message of not just doing what someone tells you to do and there are the fun little easter eggs to go back and watch for in the movie.</p>
